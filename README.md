# Javascript-socket
Is a basic socket server used for a messaging app that was done for the group project for CMPG 315 
# Problem that was to be solved 
This script served as a means of creating individual and group secure rooms for app users to interact with one another because I was attempting to create a socket connector that would work locally in my virtual ocean droplet on the could to give users a way to communicate with each other with every instance of the electron application frontend that I created for the messaging app.
